Complexity of :
• The tree construction phase -> O(n) in the best case and O(n!) in the worst case (when the maximum depth approaches the number of sons) 
• The search for a leaf with the minimum value among all the leaves in the tree -> O(n) with n the total number of nodes
• Calculating the path from the root to this leaf -> O(n) 
• A complete example of MARC guidance from its home position to the base station -> O(n) in the general case and O(n!) in the worst case
